<p class="text">DO NOT USE "FASTBOOT BOOT" TO BOOT TWRP!!
To reboot to recovery, either flash the misc_rebootrecovery.img linked below to the misc partition (by using the command "fastboot flash misc path/to/misc_rebootrecovery.img") then reboot by using "fastboot reboot", or you can reboot to recovery directly from Android.

To install TWRP with Fastboot mode:

NOTE: If you are installing TWRP while having the stock ROM installed (and not a GSI\Custom ROM), you may need to follow the stock ROM rooting guide in my XDA thread for the tablet here (to prevent the stock ROM from replacing TWRP with stock recovery): https://xdaforums.com/t/4777270/

1- Download the TWRP .img file.
2- Flash the TWRP .img file in Fastboot mode by using the command:

<code>fastboot flash recovery path/to/twrp.img</code>

3- Download misc_rebootrecovery.img from here: https://xdaforums.com/attachments/misc_rebootrecovery-img.6328346/
4- Flash misc_rebootrecovery.img by using the command:

<code>fastboot flash misc path/to/misc_rebootrecovery.img</code>

5- Reboot by using the command:

<code>fastboot reboot</code>

Your tablet should reboot to TWRP.</p>
